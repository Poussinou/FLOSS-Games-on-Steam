Manga are comics created in Japan. The problem for most people is, as they're made in Japan they're only produced in Japanese; someone has to translate them to English! Is one man able to accomplish this? Is there more to his team's relationships other than business? Can everything in a translator's life be simple and clear?

Vulture for NetHack is an isometric graphical interface for the roguelike engine: NetHack, the most celebrated member of the ancient and honorable family of games descended from Rogue and hence known as “roguelike”: bare-bones ASCII-graphics adventures set in randomly generated dungeons, in which the player fights monsters and collects items until he or she dies.

## Warzone 2100
[Game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241950/Warzone_2100/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100) | [Tutorials & Help](https://betaguide.wz2100.net/) | [Website](https://wz2100.net) | [Forums](https://forums.wz2100.net/) | [Donate](https://donations.wz2100.net/)

In the late 21st century, the world's civilizations are wiped out by a series of nuclear strikes, seemingly caused by a massive malfunction of the new NASDA (North American Strategic Defense Agency) strategic defense system. Warzone 2100, released in 1999 and developed by Pumpkin Studios, was a ground-breaking and innovative 3D real-time strategy game.

# To-Do
* Addons supported/extendable?
* Add FLOSS software available on Steam
* Add more FLOSS mods (only 1 listed for now)
* ~~Platforms supported?~~
* Add license (and specifications for assets, most of the time they aren't floss)?

I found a lot of references thanks to [this curator](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/9035867-Open-Source-Community/) and [this one as well](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38475471-Libre-Open-Source-Games/), but I found some others somewhere on the internet, I can't remember where... Thanks to all the contributors who added Games, Mods and Software via Issues or Pull Requests.
